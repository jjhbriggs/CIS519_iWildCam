# CIS519 Final Project

## File Description
**/Notebook/data_prep/generate_train_subsamples.ipynb:** 
extract a subset from the dataset for training

**/Notebook/CNN_Regressor.ipynb**                     :the implementation of CNN regression model

**/Notebook/Ensemble.ipynb**                           : the implementatio of a linear regression model to combine inference results from CNN regressor and MegaDetector

**/Notebook/MAE_Benchmarks.ipynb**                     : implementation to get MegaDetector training results

**/Notebook/Train_Predictor.ipynb**                    : perform inference with CNN-regressor and MegaDetector

**/Notebook/paper_implementation.ipynb**               : the implementation of the animal count methods mentioned in paper

**/Models**                                            : this folder contains a readme which has the link to our trained models

## How to use our code
For .ipynb files, you could either run them in the google colab or jupter nodebook with the correct folder layout.
